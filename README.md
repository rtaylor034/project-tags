[![Gfunction Stance](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstance%2Finactive.json)](https://github.com/rtaylor034/project-tags)

In most of my repositories you will find `status` and `stance` labels at the top of the primary `README.md` files.

These labels are meant to reflect:
- My thoughts on the stability/usability of the repository in its current state (`status`).
- My intent for the future of the repository (`stance`).

It is important to note that these are **not** strict rules. They simply reflect subjective thoughts/intent.

### Status:

| Label | Description |
| ---- | :---------- |
| ![Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstatus%2Fready.json&label=%20) | All features stable and documented. "production-ready". |
| ![Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstatus%2Fusable.json&label=%20) | Core functionality/features stable and documented **just** enough for user utilization. "user-ready", not "production-ready". |
| ![Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstatus%2Fviable.json&label=%20) | Technically can perform intended core functionality, but not documented/stable enough for public utilization. |
| ![Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstatus%2Fnon-viable.json&label=%20) | Lacking core functionality. Most likely in early development. |

### Stance:
| Label | Description |
| ---- | :---------- |
| ![Stance](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstance%2Factive.json&label=%20) | Actively being worked on. Frequent changes will be pushed to this repository. |
| ![Stance](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstance%2Fheld.json&label=%20) | Not currently being worked on, but planned to continue in the near future. |
| ![Stance](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstance%2Finactive.json&label=%20) | Not being worked on and has no implication of becoming `active` again. Most likely in deliberation of being changed to `archived` or `iteration`. |
| ![Stance](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstance%2Farchived.json&label=%20) | Archived. No further changes will be pushed to this repository. |
| ![Stance](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtaylor034%2Fproject-tags%2Fmain%2Ftags%2Fstance%2Fiteration.json&label=%20) | Planned to have a successor in another repository. (This repository will be set to `archived` and the successor will be linked in the `README.md` when the successor's repository is created.) |
