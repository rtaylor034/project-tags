# GFunction Project Labels

In most of my repositories you will find `status` and `stance` labels at the top of the primary `README.md` files.

These labels are meant to reflect:
- My thoughts on the stability/usability of the repository in its current state (`status`).
- My intent for the future of the repository (`stance`).

#### Status:
| Label | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `ready` | Could be considered finished (ignoring non-breaking bugs/issues); All features are stable and documented. "production-ready". |
| `usable` | Core functionality/features stable and documented *just* enough for user utilization. "user-ready", not "production-ready". |
| `viable` | Technically can perform intended core functionality, but probably not documented or stable enough for public utilization. |
| `non-viable` | Lacking core functionality. Most likely in early development. |

#### Stance:
| Label | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `active` | Is actively being worked on. Frequent changes will be pushed to this repository. |
| `held` | Progress is halted, but planned to continue in the near future. |
| `inactive` | Is not being worked on and is not planned to continue. Most likely is in deliberation of being changed to `archived` or `iteration`. |
| `archived` | Is archived (or is inherently an archive). No further changes will be pushed to this repository. |
| `iteration` | Is planned to have a successor in another repository. Once the successor repository is created, this repository will be set to `archived` and the successor will be linked in the `README.md`. |
